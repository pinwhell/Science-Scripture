# Science ↔ Scripture: An Open Conversation About Quantum Reality and Faith

**Why read this?**  
If you ever felt torn between loving science and loving Jesus — or if you simply wonder whether the deepest questions physics leaves open might have an ancient answer — you’re in the right place.  

We wrote three short introductions, each speaking in the language that might feel most natural to you:

- **[INTRO-For-Physicists.md](./docs/intros/INTRO-For-Physicists.md)**  
  For scientists, physicists, philosophers of physics — focused on foundations, coherence, and what QM really does (and does not) demand metaphysically.

- **[INTRO-For-Theologians.md](./docs/intros/INTRO-For-Theologians.md)**  
  For pastors, theologians, biblical scholars, apologists — starting from Scripture and seeing how quantum contingency resonates with core Christian claims about creation, providence, and the Logos.

- **[INTRO-For-Believers.md](./docs/intros/INTRO-For-Believers.md)**  
  For everyday followers of Jesus, students, small-group friends — simple wonder, no jargon, just the joy of discovering that science might be whispering something the Gospels have said all along.

You don’t have to agree with every word.  
You don’t have to pick a side.  
You’re simply invited to listen — respectfully — to both voices.

Grace and peace
