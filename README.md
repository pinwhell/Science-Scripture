# Science ↔ Scripture: An Open Conversation About Quantum Reality and Faith

**Why read this?**  
If you ever felt torn between loving science and loving Jesus — or if you simply wonder whether the deepest questions physics leaves open might have an ancient answer — you’re in the right place.  

We wrote three short introductions, each speaking in the language that might feel most natural to you:

- **[INTRO-For-Physicists.md](./docs/intros/INTRO-For-Physicists.md)**  
  For scientists, physicists, philosophers of physics — focused on foundations, coherence, and what QM really does (and does not) demand metaphysically.

- **[INTRO-For-Neuroscientists.md](./docs/intros/INTRO-For-Neuroscientists.md)**  
  For neuroscientists, cognitive scientists, philosophers of mind — exploring brain dynamics, contingency, consciousness, and why meaning and agency cannot be reduced to neural mechanisms alone (without denying any neuroscience).

- **[INTRO-For-Theologians.md](./docs/intros/INTRO-For-Theologians.md)**  
  For pastors, theologians, biblical scholars, apologists — starting from Scripture and seeing how quantum contingency resonates with core Christian claims about creation, providence, and the Logos.

- **[INTRO-For-Believers.md](./docs/intros/INTRO-For-Believers.md)**  
  For everyday followers of Jesus, students, small-group friends — simple wonder, no jargon, just the joy of discovering that science might be whispering something the Gospels have said all along.

**The Fruits: Formal Syntheses**  
As this conversation matures, it has begun to yield "Fruits" — formal technical documents that bridge the gap between Quantum Mechanics, General Relativity, and the Logos. These are not just ideas; they are rigorous frameworks for unification:

You don’t have to agree with every word.  
You don’t have to pick a side.  
You’re simply invited to listen — respectfully — to both voices.

Grace and peace
