# Quantum Openness Without New Physics — A Coherent Ontological Reading

**Ultra-TL;DR**  
QM is silent on *why this outcome* occurs.  
PCI / PAI keeps every QM prediction intact (Born rule exact, no hidden variables, no collapse dynamics) while offering the cleanest metaphysical story:  
- Physical description = possibility space + transition amplitudes  
- Actuality = non-physical, ontologically distinct step  
- Actualization requires a ground that is unified, intentional, normative → personal Logos  
- Human participation = constraint within physical openness (no probability violation)  
- Consciousness = phenomenological registration of participation, not causal trigger  

No miracles in the equations. No dualism in the dynamics. Just refusal to let brute-fact regress or multiverse inflation substitute for explanatory adequacy.

**Why this matters right now**  
Every major QM interpretation faces the same three problems:  
1. Why definite history at all?  
2. Why intelligible / narratable history?  
3. Why normativity of rational inference?  

Impersonal grounds (laws, chance, many worlds, information) either regress infinitely or quietly smuggle personhood back in (observer, rationality, “perspectival facts”).  
PCI/PAI makes the requirement explicit and minimal: actuality is grounded in unified personal being (Logos) — compatible with orthodox Christology without requiring any new testable physics.
