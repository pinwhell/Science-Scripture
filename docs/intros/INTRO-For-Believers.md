# Science Discovered an Open Universe — The Bible Always Knew It Was Held by Jesus

**Ultra-TL;DR**  
Quantum physics says: the future isn’t locked in stone. Tiny possibilities stay possible until reality picks one. Nothing in the equations forces *exactly which one* happens.  

The Bible has been saying the same thing for 2,000+ years:  
“in him all things hold together” (Colossians 1:17)  
“upholding the universe by the word of his power” (Hebrews 1:3)  
Jesus — the living Word — is the reason anything definite exists at all.  

This project simply connects those two truths:  
- Quantum openness = the universe depends on something/someone beyond physics  
- Our real choices matter — we help write the story inside the space God left open  
- Jesus (the Logos) is the personal Reason who makes one definite world instead of endless maybes  

No lab test will ever say “Jesus proved.”  
But the more science learns how *open* reality really is, the more it leaves room for the exact kind of personal, purposeful sustaining the Gospels describe.  

Perfect if you ever thought: “I love Jesus *and* I love science — do I have to choose?”
