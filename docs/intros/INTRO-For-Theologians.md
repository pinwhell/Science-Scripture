# The Logos as Ontological Ground — Quantum Contingency Meets Colossians 1 & John 1

**Ultra-TL;DR**  
Scripture already teaches:  
- Creation is radically contingent (sustained every moment — Heb 1:3)  
- All things cohere in the Logos/Christ (Col 1:17)  
- Human beings participate as image-bearers with real (though creaturely) agency  

Quantum mechanics now shows physics *itself* is radically contingent: no local hidden variables (Bell), no deterministic completion possible. Outcomes are not forced by prior states alone.  

PCI / PAI reads this contingency christologically:  
- Physical laws → describe stable possibilities (God’s faithful regular governance)  
- Indeterminacy → creaturely openness that awaits actualization  
- Actual definite history → continuously given by the personal, unifying Logos  
- Finite freedom → participatory co-narration within divine providence (non-competitive)  

The framework does **not**  
- Turn indeterminacy into miracles  
- Make physics explain redemption  
- Prove the Trinity from wavefunctions  

It **does**  
- Remove the materialist blockade that says “science closed the causal gap”  
- Show that the most parsimonious ground for an intelligible, actual, normatively rational world is precisely the kind of unified personal being Scripture names Logos/Christ
