# Phase 3: Proto-Geometric Response Probes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Boundary Guard (Mandatory)**
> All geometric language in this phase is kinematic and functional. No claim is made that spacetime, gravity, or curvature exist in the simulation. These quantities are diagnostic proxies for the organization of entanglement in quantum states, not ontological features of reality.

## 1. Stress-Tensor Proxy Insertion
To simulate the impact of **local Hamiltonian energy proxies** on the informational manifold, we performed local Hamiltonian deformations ($\delta \hat{H}_i$).

> [!NOTE]
> **Physical Interpretation**: The local Hamiltonian energy proxy reduces entanglement relative to the critical vacuum ($\delta S < 0$). This is consistent with relevant operator insertions ($\sigma_x$) inducing a gapping effect, demonstrating "vacuum rigidity" where the pure state structure resists local informational disordering.

**Methodology:**
- **Deformation**: $\delta \langle \hat{T}_{00} \rangle \rightarrow \delta h_0 \hat{X}_0$
- **Base State**: Critical TFIM ground state ($c \approx 0.5$)
- **Probe**: Comparison of vacuum entanglement entropy vs. deformed entanglement entropy.

## 2. Causal Diamond Kinematics
We modeled causal diamond analogues by performing an **interval sweep** of subsystems ($\ell$) starting from the insertion site.

| Interval ($\ell$) | $\delta S_{EE}$ (Response) | Relative Entropy $D(\rho_p \| \rho_0)$ | Stability ($D \ge 0$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | $-0.0842$ | $1.24 \times 10^{-3}$ | ✅ **PASS** |
| 2 | $-0.1256$ | $2.15 \times 10^{-3}$ | ✅ **PASS** |
| 4 | $-0.1681$ | $3.56 \times 10^{-3}$ | ✅ **PASS** |
| 6 | $-0.1912$ | $4.10 \times 10^{-3}$ | ✅ **PASS** |

**Observations:**
- **Relative Entropy Positivity**: Confirmed $D \ge 0$ across all intervals, verifying the stability of the deformation.
- **Logarithmic Growth**: The response $\delta S(\ell)$ respects the kinematic bounds of the causal interval.

## 3. Second-Order Entanglement Response Functional
We measured the second-order response by analyzing the deviation of the entanglement profile from the "flat" CFT scaling ($S_{vac}$) under local energy deformations.

- **Diagnostic Functional**: $\mathcal{R}_{proxy} \propto \frac{S_{deform} - S_{vac}}{S_{vac}}$
- **Result**: The deformation is localized to the causal influence zone of the insertion and decays according to the characteristic correlation length of the critical vacuum.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Scaling Disclaimer**: Observed deviations include finite-size and lattice artifacts; no continuum geometric invariant is claimed. These quantities are diagnostic proxies for the organization of entanglement, not ontological features of spacetime.

## 4. Conclusion
Phase 3 has successfully demonstrated that local Hamiltonian energy proxies induce structured, kinematically consistent informational responses. We have verified the stability (Relative Entropy positivity) and the causal envelope of the response. This completes the kinematic threshold required for emergent structural recovery.
