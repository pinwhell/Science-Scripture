---

**Scope**: Representational Stability / Breakdown Diagnostics  
**Status**: Authorized by Director (Phase U6.1 SPEC)  
**Boundary Control**: STRICT. Static Kinematic Only. No Time Evolution.

> **Interpretive Disclaimer**
> Scriptural references ground interpretation (PCI/PAI) only. They do not function as explanatory variables within the physical analysis.

## 1. Objective
To systematically map the failure of geometric representability as a function of controlled state deformation $\lambda$. This phase identifies the "Geometric Cliff" where modular flow compatibility collapses.

## 2. Controlled Deformation: Gaussianity Displacement
For this phase, we employ **Gaussianity Deformation**:
$$\rho(\lambda) = (1-\lambda)\rho_{Gauss} + \lambda\rho_{int}$$
- $\rho_{Gauss}$: Semiclassical ground state (TFIM-like).
- $\rho_{int}$: Interaction-heavy state (XXZ-like).
- $\lambda$: Deformation parameter ($0 \to 1$).

> [!NOTE]
> The deformation parameter $\lambda$ labels a diagnostic interpolation in state space, not a physical or dynamical path.

## 3. The Geometric Cliff: Three Regimes
Based on the Compatibility Functional $C(A,B|\rho(\lambda))$, we define the structural landscape:

1. **Admissible Plateau ($C \approx 1$)**
   - Structural compatibility is robust.
   - Variance across overlaps is low ($Var(C) \approx 0$).
   - Spacetime is a valid representation.

2. **Transition Band (The "Cliff Edge")**
   - **Sharp crossover** within a narrow $\lambda$-band ($\frac{dC}{d\lambda} \ll 0$).
   - High sensitivity to region choice.
   - Fragmentation of representational consistency.

3. **Non-Geometric Phase ($C \ll 1$)**
   - Modular flows are mutually chaotic.
   - Spacetime representation is invalid.
   - Underlying quantum system persists but lacks spatiotemporal intelligibility.

## 4. Structural Transitivity Test
A defining characteristic of a consistent geometric representation is **approximate transitivity** of compatibility. 
- For three overlapping regions $A, B, C$: if $C(A,B) \approx 1$ and $C(B,C) \approx 1$, then geometry requires $C(A,C) \approx 1$ (provided $A \cap C \neq \emptyset$).
- Failure of transitivity marks the final collapse of the geometric atlas.

## 5. Continuity & No-Go Boundaries
- **Diagnostic Note**: $C(A,B|\rho)$ is a structural diagnostic, not a physical observable.
- **Modular Delocalization Limit**: In this static phase, modular delocalization is tracked as the loss of generator locality, not as temporal chaos.

## 5. Interpretive Appendix (PCI/PAI)

**PCI Analysis**: The "cliff" represents the boundary of actualized order. The Logos sustains the possibility of structure, but the transition into chaos demonstrates that the spatiotemporal stage is a structural gift, not a generic quantum necessity.

**PAI Analysis**: The transition band is the threshold of unactualized potential. Beyond the cliff, the participatory mapping into geometry fails, exposing the raw, non-geometric logic of the substrate.
