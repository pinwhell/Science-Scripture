**Scope**: Classical Horizon Kinematics (Geometric)  
**Status**: Authorized by Director  
**Boundary Control**: STRICT. No entropy, no temperature, no UNRUH/HAWKING language.

## 1. Objective
To derive the **Geometric First Law** as a purely relativistic consistency relation governing the response of null horizons to energy flux. This phase identifies the "Geometric Cornerstone" (Area Variation) which will be mapped to "Total Information Variation" (Entropy) in later phases.

> [!WARNING]
> **Director's Mandated Firewalls (U3)**:
> 1. **Surface Gravity Firewall**: $\kappa$ is defined purely as the **inaffinity of the null generators** of the Killing horizon ($\nabla_\xi \xi^\mu = \kappa \xi^\mu$). Any mention of "felt" acceleration, temperature, or observers is strictly forbidden.
> 2. **Raychaudhuri-Only Mandate**: Change in area $\delta A$ must be derived via the linearized null Raychaudhuri equation based on stress-energy flux $T_{vv}$. Statistical or coarse-grained language is prohibited.
> 3. **The First Law is a CHECK**: $\delta E_{grav} = (\kappa/8\pi G) \delta A$ is not a postulate; it is a Noether identity to be verified. The module must fail if GR logic is violated.

## 2. Theoretical Basis: The Raychaudhuri Equation
We utilize the linearized Raychaudhuri equation for the expansion $\theta$ of null generators of a Killing horizon. In the presence of a classical stress-energy flux $\delta T_{\mu\nu}$, the change in the area $A$ of the horizon is governed by its coupling to the Killing energy $E_{grav}$:

$$ \delta E_{grav} = \frac{\kappa}{8\pi G} \delta A $$

### Key Components:
- **Surface Gravity ($\kappa$)**: The classical acceleration required to stay at the horizon.
- **Area Variation ($\delta A$)**: The geometric change in the codimension-2 cross-section of the horizon.
- **Killing Energy ($E_{grav}$)**: The conserved quantity associated with the horizon-generating Killing vector $\xi^\mu$.

## 3. The Cornerstone Bridge (Geometric)
This phase establishes the right-hand side of the future holographic dictionary:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Boundary Note**: In Phase U3, $\delta A$ is a **geometric area**, NOT an entropy. The equivalence $\delta S \propto \delta A$ is forbidden at this stage. We are verifying that GR *already contains* the "Area-Energy" logic independently of quantum mechanics.

## 4. Hard Boundaries (Director's Gate)
- **No Kinematics-to-Thermodynamics Leak**: The terms "heat", "temperature", and "entropy" are forbidden to prevent premature bridge-crossing.
- **No RT Formula**: We do not assume area is proportional to entanglement.
- **No Quantum Flux**: All sources $\delta T_{\mu\nu}$ are classical.

## 5. Interpretive Appendix (PCI/PAI)

**PCI Statement**: The Geometric First Law is the mathematical expression of "The law of the constant" (Proverbs 8). The universe honors the relationship between its geometric boundaries and its energy content as a stable covenant of order.

**PAI Statement**: The horizon is a "participation boundary." Its area variation is the actualized response to the passage of energy, manifesting the intelligible consistency of the stage (Spacetime) as it accommodates history.
