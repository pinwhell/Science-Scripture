# The Fruits of Science & Scripture

This project has yielded several mature, technical "Fruits" — formal syntheses that explore the "Straight Path" of QM-GR unification. These documents are designed to be scientifically rigorous, philosophically disciplined, and theologically faithful.

### 1. The Unification Charter
- **[QM-GR Unification Constraint Charter](./QM-GR-Unification.md)**  
  The foundational guide for unification, establishing the "Straight Path" and strict PAI/PCI guardrails for conceptual hygiene.

### 2. The Relational Structure
- **[Relational Structure: Physics Note](./Unified-Relational-Structure-Physics.md)**  
  A purely structural physical model of spacetime emerging from entanglement (ER=EPR), purified of ontological claims.
- **[Relational Structure: Interpretive Reflection](./Unified-Relational-Structure-Interpretive.md)**  
  The non-physical context for the physics note, identifying the Logos as the ground of intelligibility and actuality.

### 3. Mathematical Equation Recovery
- **[Equation Recovery Plan](./Equation-Recovery-Plan.md)**  
  A strategic roadmap for recovering the fundamental equations of QM and GR from a Tensor Network substrate.
- **[Equation Recovery Synthesis](./Equation-Recovery-Synthesis.md)**  
  The formal realization of the recovery plan, deriving the Schrödinger and Einstein equations as effective structural descriptions within the PAI/PCI framework.

**Why "Fruits"?**  
A fruit is the result of a living process. These documents are the result of a living dialogue between the laws of nature and the Word that sustains them. They are offered as a starting point for a science that honors its limits and a faith that loves the truth.
