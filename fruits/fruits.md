# The Fruits of Science & Scripture: A Gold-Standard Synthesis

This project provides a rigorous, multi-level framework for unifying Quantum Mechanics (QM) and General Relativity (GR) under the constraints of the **Participatory Actualization Interpretation (PAI)** and **Participatory Christological Interpretation (PCI)**.

Following the Gold-Standard Audit, the project outputs are structured into three distinct, non-overlapping streams to prevent category errors.

## 1. Physics-Facing Stream (Zero Theology)
**Domain**: Structural Correspondence, Kinematic Consistencies, Constraints.
- **[Constraints on Admissible Geometric Reconstructions](./Physics-Facing-Structure.md)**  
  The core technical paper. Summary of numerical constraints (Ising CFT, First Law, Linear Superposition) on any semiclassical geometric recovery. Zero metaphysical claims.

## 2. Philosophy-Facing Stream (Ontology of Actuality)
**Domain**: Ontology, Normativity, Anti-Illusionism.
- **[The Ontology of Actuality](./Philosophy-of-Actuality.md)**  
  A philosophical defense of the distinction between Probability (Physics) and Actuality (Ontology). Arguments against illusionism and for the grounding of normativity.

## 3. Theology-Facing Stream (The Ground of Truth)
**Domain**: Revelation, Christology, Agency.
- **[Theological Synthesis: The Logos as Ground](./Theological-Synthesis.md)**  
  The explicit identification of the Ground of Intelligibility with the Person of Christ (Romans 11:36). Clarifies the relationship between Providence and Quantum Indeterminacy.

## 4. Supporting Documentation & Code
- **[Numerical Proof-of-Concept Code](./numerical_recovery_poc.py)**  
  The Python codebase implementing the critical Ising CFT probes (Phases 1-4).
- **[Numerical Toy Demo](./Numerical-Toy-Demo.md)**  
  A simplified educational walkthrough of the entanglement entropy concept.
- **[Phase 2 Results: First Law Verification](./Phase-2-Probes.md)**
- **[Phase 3 Results: Kinematic Structure](./Phase-3-Probes.md)**
- **[Phase 4 Results: Conditional Reconstruction](./Phase-4-Reconstruction.md)**
- **[Phase 6 Results: Time & Dynamics](./Phase-6-Dynamics.md)**
- **[Phase 7 Results: Comparative Dynamics](./Phase-7-Comparative.md)**

## 5. Foundational Charters
- **[The Unification Charter (Constraint Charter)](./QM-GR-Unification.md)**  
  The original "Constitution" of the project, defining the axioms of Conceptual Hygiene.
- **[Equation Recovery Plan](./Equation-Recovery-Plan.md)**  
  The strategic roadmap for the structural correspondence program.
