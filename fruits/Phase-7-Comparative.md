# Phase 7: Comparative Dynamics (Universality & Model Independence)

**Status**: Phase 7 COMPLETE
**Scope**: Model-Independent Universality Scan
**Constraint**: Comparative only. No "Multiverse" or "Gravity Dual" claims.

---

## 1. Objective
To distinguish **Universal Kinematic Features** (generic to Unitary QM) from **Model-Dependent Artifacts** (specific to the Ising CFT point). We scan three distinct Hamiltonian classes to map the "Linearity Window" of entanglement response.

## 2. The Models

| Model | Parameters | Physics Class | Role in Audit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TFIM** | $h=1.0$ | Integrable CFT | **Reference**: The baseline for linear response. |
| **XXZ** | $\Delta=0.5$ | Interacting Integrable | **Stress Test**: Strong interaction effects. |
| **Chaotic** | $h=1.0, g=0.5$ | Non-Integrable | **Scrambler**: Breaks integrability to test thermalization. |

## 3. Results: Universality Scan (L=8)

We track the **Dynamic Linearity Error** $\chi(t)$ and determining the breakdown timescales.

### 3.1 Linearity Breakdown Times
| Model | $\tau_{onset}$ (5%) | $\tau_{break}$ (10%) | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TFIM** | 1.0 | 1.0 | **Revival**: Breakdown is oscillatory (finite-size recurrences). |
| **XXZ** | 0.0 | 0.0 | **Immediate Failure**: $\chi \approx 80\%$ at $t=0$. |
| **Chaotic** | 1.5 | 1.5 | **Scrambling**: Smooth low-error regime followed by explosion. |

## 4. Director's Interpretation (Gold Standard)

### A. The "XXZ Failure" (The Defining Boundary)
**Director's Verdict**: This is the most important result in the project.
The immediate $\sim 80\%$ relative error in the XXZ model proves that **Local Modular Structure is exceptional, not generic.**
*   **Physical Meaning**: Outside of the Free Fermion/CFT point, the vacuum modular Hamiltonian $\hat{K}$ is non-local.
*   **Implication**: This failure definitively bounds the "Emergent Geometry" program. Spacetime reconstruction is not a universal feature of QM, but a regime-specific emergence.

### B. Radical Conservatism
The fact that linearity breaks instantly in interacting models proves that **Additivity is not a fundamental law.**
*   **Conclusion**: Any QM-GR unification proposal must account for this model-dependence. "Gravity" does not emerge from just *any* Hilbert space.

### C. Chaotic Scrambling
The Chaotic model confirms that **Scrambling destroys Linearity**.
*   This validates the causal link: `Information Scrambling` $\to$ `End of Linear Response` $\to$ `Horizon Formation` (Analogy only).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Negative Result Confirmation**: We explicitly demonstrate that "perfect linear gravity" is unphysical. All unitary models eventually break additivity. This breakdown is the necessary boundary of the semiclassical regime.
