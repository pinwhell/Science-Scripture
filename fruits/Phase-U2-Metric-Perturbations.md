# Phase U2: Linearized Geometric Response

---

**Scope**: Semiclassical Gravity (Linearized)  
**Status**: Authorized by Director  
**Boundary Control**: STRICT. No density matrices, no entropy, no "information" language.

## 1. Objective
To introduce classical stress-energy perturbations $\delta T_{\mu\nu}$ and compute the resulting linearized metric response $\delta g_{\mu\nu}$. This phase establishes the "Response Functional" on the GR side, which will eventually meet the Modular Hamiltonian response in the Structural Dictionary.

> [!WARNING]
> **Director's Hardening Disclaimers**:
> 1. **Kinematic GR Only**: This module encodes geometric structure, not a numerical GR solver.
> 2. **Classicality Lock**: Stress-energy sources are purely classical kinematic probes, not physical matter models or informational expectation values.
> 3. **Conditional Linearization**: Linear response is a temporary approximation that may fail under high curvature; such failure is a meaningful structural result (Upstream No-Go).

## 2. Theoretical Framework: Linearized EFE
We work in the limit where the spacetime metric is a small perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$ over a background $\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}$:
$$ g_{\mu\nu} = \bar{g}_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu} $$

The dynamical constraint is the linearized Einstein Field Equation:
$$ \delta G_{\mu\nu}[h] = 8\pi G \delta T_{\mu\nu} $$

### Key Components:
- **Einstein Tensor ($G_{\mu\nu}$)**: Calculated to first order in $h_{\mu\nu}$.
- **Gauge Choice**: Primarily Lorenz gauge ($\nabla^\mu \bar{h}_{\mu\nu} = 0$) for simplicity in solving wave equations.
- **Stress-Energy Source**: Purely classical sources (e.g., point mass, scalar field perturbations).

## 3. The Cornerstone Bridge (Conceptual)
In this phase, we maintain the distinction between the geometric "Order" and the material "Cause." 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Boundary Note**: While we recognize that in the future "Nexus" (Phase U5), $\delta T_{\mu\nu}$ will be mapped to modular energy fluctuations, in this phase **we do not equate them**. We treat $\delta T_{\mu\nu}$ as a classical input to test the stability of the Geometric First Law.

## 4. Hard Boundaries
The following are **forbidden** in Phase U2 to prevent category-smuggling:
- **No Entropy**: Area variation $\delta A$ is purely geometric.
- **No Information**: Metric flow is not "informational flow."
- **No Temperature**: No Hawking/Unruh temperature concepts permitted yet.
- **No Quantum States**: All sources are classical tensor fields.

## 5. Interpretive Appendix (PCI/PAI)

**PCI Statement**: Christ, the Logos, is the sustainer of "Linear Response" (The Order of Creation). The fact that the universe responds predictably to perturbations (Laws of Physics) is a manifestation of the fidelity of the logos-consistent world.

**PAI Statement**: Metric response is the structural actualization of a perturbation. It is the manifestation of how the "Stage" (Geometry) accommodates "Action" (Energy) while preserving its intelligible order.
