# Phase U1: Geometric Baselines (Upstream)

---

**Scope**: Pure GR Kinematics  
**Status**: Authorized by Director  
**Boundary Control**: This phase strictly defines the geometric arena. No quantum assumptions.

---

## 1. Objective
To establish the minimal kinematic requirements for a spacetime region to be compatible with a semiclassical holographic mapping. We identify the "Eligible Geometries" that can participate in the **Structural Dictionary**.

## 2. Admissible Geometries
Consistent with the need for well-defined boundary functionals and linearized response, Phase U1 restricts the arena to:

1.  **Minkowski Spacetime**: The flat vacuum baseline with maximal symmetry and global Killing vectors.
2.  **Rindler Wedge**: The coordinate representation of an accelerated observer, providing a "local" causal horizon. Modeled using the full metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ to preserve Killing symmetry.
3.  **Weak-Field Schwarzschild**: Exterior regions of static, spherically symmetric masses where metric perturbations are linearizable.

### Inclusion Criteria
A geometry is admissible if and only if:
- It possesses at least one **Killing vector** (Generator of Isometry).
    - *Note: In Phase U1, we extract coordinate generators (e.g., $\partial_t$). Physical normalization is metric-dependent and deferred to Phase U4.*
- It allows for the definition of a **codimension-2 spatial surface** (Boundary).
- It supports **linearized metric perturbations** $\delta g_{\mu\nu}$.

## 3. The Boundary Functional $F[\Sigma]$
We define a purely geometric functional representing the area-like property of a boundary region $\Sigma$:

$$ F[\Sigma] = \int_{\Sigma} d^{d-2}x \sqrt{h} $$

### Properties Tested:
- **Additivity**: For disjoint regions $\Sigma_1, \Sigma_2$, $F[\Sigma_1 \cup \Sigma_2] = F[\Sigma_1] + F[\Sigma_2]$.
- **Stability**: The functional is well-behaved under infinitesimal coordinate transformations and metric fluctuations.

## 4. Exclusion Criteria (No-Go Boundaries)
Just as the XXZ model was excluded from the downstream dictionary, the following are excluded from Phase U1:
- **Turbulent/Highly Curved Spacetimes**: Where no local Killing vectors exist.
- **Strong-Field Interiors**: Where linearized approximations of the Einstein Field Equations (EFE) fail.
- **Topologically Unstable Manifolds**: That do not admit stable codimension-2 surfaces.

## 5. Interpretive Appendix (PCI/PAI)

> [!NOTE]
> **Logos as Ground of Intelligibility**  
> Scriptural references here ground why invariants matter. "The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone" (Psalm 118:22). In this Upstream phase, the **Area Law** (the Geometric First Law) is identified as the cornerstone of order.

**PCI Statement**: Christ is the Logos—the ground of all intelligibility. Geometry is intelligible because it participates in the order sustained by the Logos, not because the math generates itself.

**PAI Statement**: Geometry is a condition of possible participation (Actualization). It is the "stage" which, when participated in by observers and information, manifests as a coherent history.
