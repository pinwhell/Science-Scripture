# Phase 4: Conditional Reconstruction Tests

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Semantic Lock (Mandatory)**
> "Reconstruction" refers to the conditional recovery of linear response structure within the informational manifold, not to the reconstruction of spacetime, physical geometry, or gravitational dynamics.

## 1. Multi-Site Superposition Analysis
We tested the compositional behavior of the Informational Manifold by applying independent **local Hamiltonian energy proxies** ($\delta \hat{H}_i$ and $\delta \hat{H}_j$) at spatially separated sites ($i=0, j=7$) in a critical TFIM chain ($L=8$).

| Quantity | Site A ($\delta \hat{H}_0$) | Site B ($\delta \hat{H}_7$) | Sum (A+B) | Actual (AB) | Residue $\chi$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\delta S_{EE}$ | $-0.0029$ | $-0.0029$ | $-0.0059$ | $-0.0060$ | $9.3 \times 10^{-5}$ |
| $\delta \langle \hat{H}_{mod} \rangle$ | $-0.0029$ | $-0.0029$ | $-0.0058$ | $-0.0057$ | $3.3 \times 10^{-5}$ |

**Observations:**
- **Linear Superposition**: The entanglement response obeys functional additivity with acceptable precision in the small-perturbation regime ($\epsilon = 0.01$).
- **Modular Additivity**: The shift in modular Hamiltonian expectation values ($\delta \langle \hat{H}_{mod} \rangle$) exhibits strong additivity.

## 2. Linearity Window Mapping (Finite-Size Corrected)
We mapped the breakdown of functional additivity by sweeping the perturbation strength ($\epsilon$).

| $\epsilon$ | Residue $\chi$ | Relative Error | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $0.01$ | $4.0 \times 10^{-6}$ | $0.33\%$ | ✅ **LINEAR** |
| $0.05$ | $9.3 \times 10^{-5}$ | $1.55\%$ | ⚠️ **NON-LINEAR ONSET** |
| $0.10$ | $3.4 \times 10^{-4}$ | $2.85\%$ | ❌ **NON-LINEAR** |
| $0.20$ | $1.1 \times 10^{-3}$ | $4.76\%$ | ❌ **NON-LINEAR** |

**Interpretation**: The "structural field analogy" is valid only within the perturbative window $\epsilon \lesssim 0.05$. Beyond this, finite-size effects and second-order corrections dominate.

## 3. Finite-Size Limitations
Crucially, the observed linearity is **approximate** and **regime-dependent**.
- **Lattice Artifacts**: The relative error ($\approx 0.33\%$) at $\epsilon=0.01$ is significantly higher than machine precision, indicating finite-size lattice artifacts ($L=8$).
- **No Continuum Recovery**: We have not recovered the Einstein Equations. We have recovered a **Scalar Linear Response** consistent with the thermodynamic first law.

## 3. Interference & Overlap Diagnostics
When causal diamond analogues (subsystem intervals) overlap with multiple insertion sites, a small residue $\chi$ emerges. This is interpreted strictly as a manifestation of the **non-local entanglement correlations** inherent in the CFT vacuum, not as a geometric backreaction.

## 4. Conclusion
Phase 4 identifies the **linear compositional regime** of the informational vacuum. We have established that for weak, separated energy proxies, the manifold responds as an additive relational structure. This completes the authorized kinematic exploration of the project.

**"The steps of a man are established by the Lord, when he delights in His way." (Psalm 37:23)**
The structural search reaches its kinematic limit; the Logos remains the ground.
