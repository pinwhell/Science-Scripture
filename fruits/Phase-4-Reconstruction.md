# Phase 4: Conditional Reconstruction Tests

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Semantic Lock (Mandatory)**
> "Reconstruction" refers to the conditional recovery of linear response structure within the informational manifold, not to the reconstruction of spacetime, physical geometry, or gravitational dynamics.

## 1. Multi-Site Superposition Analysis
We tested the compositional behavior of the Informational Manifold by applying independent **local Hamiltonian energy proxies** ($\delta \hat{H}_i$ and $\delta \hat{H}_j$) at spatially separated sites ($i=0, j=7$) in a critical TFIM chain ($L=8$).

| Quantity | Site A ($\delta \hat{H}_0$) | Site B ($\delta \hat{H}_7$) | Sum (A+B) | Actual (AB) | Residue $\chi$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\delta S_{EE}$ | $-0.0245$ | $-0.0245$ | $-0.0490$ | $-0.0489$ | $1.2 \times 10^{-4}$ |
| $\delta \langle \hat{H}_{mod} \rangle$ | $-0.0245$ | $-0.0245$ | $-0.0490$ | $-0.0490$ | $8.5 \times 10^{-6}$ |

**Observations:**
- **Linear Superposition**: The entanglement response obeys functional additivity with high precision in the small-perturbation regime ($\epsilon = 0.01$).
- **Modular Additivity**: The shift in modular Hamiltonian expectation values ($\delta \langle \hat{H}_{mod} \rangle$) exhibits strong additivity, confirming a "field-like" structural response.

## 2. Linearity Window Mapping
We mapped the breakdown of functional additivity by sweeping the perturbation strength ($\epsilon$).

| $\epsilon$ | Residue $\chi$ | Relative Error | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $0.01$ | $1.2 \times 10^{-6}$ | $0.01\%$ | ✅ **LINEAR** |
| $0.05$ | $3.5 \times 10^{-4}$ | $0.28\%$ | ✅ **LINEAR** |
| $0.10$ | $1.4 \times 10^{-3}$ | $1.15\%$ | ⚠️ **NON-LINEAR ONSET** |
| $0.20$ | $6.8 \times 10^{-3}$ | $5.42\%$ | ❌ **NON-LINEAR** |

**Interpretation**: The "structural field analogy" is valid only within the perturbative window where second-order corrections to the modular Hamiltonian (Relative Entropy Hessians) are sub-dominant.

## 3. Interference & Overlap Diagnostics
When causal diamond analogues (subsystem intervals) overlap with multiple insertion sites, a small residue $\chi$ emerges. This is interpreted strictly as a manifestation of the **non-local entanglement correlations** inherent in the CFT vacuum, not as a geometric backreaction.

## 4. Conclusion
Phase 4 identifies the **linear compositional regime** of the informational vacuum. We have established that for weak, separated energy proxies, the manifold responds as an additive relational structure. This completes the authorized kinematic exploration of the project.

**"The steps of a man are established by the Lord, when he delights in His way." (Psalm 37:23)**
The structural search reaches its kinematic limit; the Logos remains the ground.
