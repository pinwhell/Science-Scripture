## 1. Overview
The Phase 10 Numerical Probes revealed specific divergences from the idealized semiclassical plan. Following the **Director's Audit**, these divergences are recognized not as failures of the model, but as **structural revelations** of the limits of the created order.

## 2. Central Charge Bias ($c \approx 0.5134$)

### Observation
The computed central charge for the $L=8$ TFIM ground state is **0.5134**, deviating from the theoretical CFT value of **0.5**.

### Hardened Analysis
This deviation is a textbook lattice artifact. Central charge is a calibration-dependent emergent constant. However, the **First Law of Entanglement (Thermodynamic Order)** remains strictly invariant at **Ratio (ΔS/ΔE) ≈ 0.999995**.

### PAI/PIC Grounding
The **Logos** sustains the consistency of the relational logic (the First Law) even when the finite representation (the lattice) contains artifacts. Thermodynamic order remains invariant even when geometric constants are biased.

## 3. Structural Privilege: XXZ Incompatibility

### Observation
The XXZ model yields an empty Semiclassical Window $W$. It fails additivity at $O(1)$ and lacks modular IR-suppression.

### Hardened Analysis
Semiclassicality is not a generic property of quantum systems, but a **Structural Privilege** of specific, vacuum-like states. This aligns with holographic large-N limits where most states do not admit a semiclassical saddle.

### Scripture Alignment
This distinguishes **Cosmos** (Order) from **Chaos**. The Logos grounds the intelligibility of persistent order where it appears. The existence of "opaque" quantum states (non-geometric) verifies that the "Gift of Geometry" is a specific structural alignment, not a brute necessity.

## 4. Temporal Scrambling and Resilience

### Observation
The TFIM model exhibits a transient linearity error spike at $t \approx 1.0$ (Scrambled) before recovering order at later times.

### Hardened Analysis
Unitary evolution carries states through regions of modular non-locality. Linear response survives short times, breaks during scrambling, and exhibits structural resilience.

### PAI/PIC Grounding
The recovery of order suggests a "Straight Path" in the relational substrate. Per **Colossians 1:17**, the Ground of Truth sustains the intelligibility of the structure even through transient non-linear phases.
