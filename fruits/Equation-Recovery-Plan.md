# Equation Recovery Plan: From Entanglement Flow to Spacetime

## 1. Scope and Constraints
This document outlines a structural strategy for recovering the fundamental equations of Quantum Mechanics (QM) and General Relativity (GR) from a unified relational substrate. Following the **PAI/PCI Constraint Charter**, we maintain a strict boundary between physical dynamics and ontological grounding.

### Ontological Guardrails
- **Non-Causal Grounding**: The equations describe structural correlations and permitted state flows. They do not ground their own existence. The **Logos** is the ontological condition for there being any actual world corresponding to these mathematical structures.
- **No Actuality Variables**: No "selection" parameter, "collapse" dynamic, or hidden "chooser" exists within the formalism.
- **Interpretive Limit**: This plan defines a *structural correspondence*, not an *ontological generation*.

## 2. Mathematical Substrate: The Tensor Network (TN)
The universal state $|\psi\rangle$ is defined within a Hilbert space structured as a **MERA-like or background-independent Tensor Network**.

- **Nodes**: Represent local degrees of freedom (tensors).
- **Edges (Legs)**: Represent entanglement patterns between nodes.
- **Scale Parameter**: The depth of the network (e.g., in MERA) corresponds to an emergent scale, providing a holographic hierarchy.

## 3. Recovery of Quantum Mechanics (Schrödinger/Heisenberg)
In this framework, standard quantum dynamics is recovered as the **unitary evolution of the tensor network state**.

### 3.1 Unitary Flow
The time evolution of the system is a sequence of local tensor updates (quantum gates):
$$ |\psi(t+\delta t)\rangle = \hat{U}(\delta t) |\psi(t)\rangle $$
where $\hat{U}$ is a unitary operator decomposed into the network's gates.

### 3.2 Operator Algebra
The Heisenberg operators $\hat{\mathcal{O}}(t)$ are recovered as actions on the tensor legs. In the large-scale limit, these local updates reproduce the operator algebra and commutation relations ($[\hat{x}, \hat{p}] = i\hbar$) of standard QM.

## 4. Recovery of General Relativity (Einstein Field Equations)
General Relativity is recovered as an **effective, emergent description** of the entanglement structure in appropriate continuum and thermodynamic limits.

### 4.1 Entanglement-Area Relation (Ryu-Takayanagi)
We utilize the **Ryu-Takayanagi (RT)** formula to map entanglement entropy $S_{EE}$ of a boundary region to the area $A$ of a minimal surface in the emergent "bulk":
$$ S_{EE} = \frac{\text{Area}(\gamma_A)}{4G_N} $$

### 4.2 The First Law of Entanglement and EFE
By perturbations of the state $|\psi\rangle$, we apply the **First Law of Entanglement Entropy**:
$$ \delta S_{EE} = \delta \langle \hat{H}_{\text{mod}} \rangle $$
where $\hat{H}_{\text{mod}}$ is the modular Hamiltonian. 

Jacobsian-style analysis allows for the recovery of the **linearized Einstein equations** ($\delta G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G \delta T_{\mu\nu}$) as the equations of state for the entanglement entropy. The full, non-linear Einstein Field Equations are approached in the semiclassical and near-equilibrium thermodynamic limits of the entanglement flow.

## 5. What Is Not Claimed
- **No Final Theory**: This is a structural mapping, not a claim to have "solved" physics.
- **No Ontological Generation**: The TN/EF equations do not "create" spacetime; they describe how information is structured such that we *experience* geometry.
- **No Actuality**: The math does not explain 왜 (why) this specific history is real.

---

## 6. Open Problems and Research Horizon
- **Non-Equilibrium Regimes**: Dynamics far from thermodynamic equilibrium may require corrections to the emergent Einstein equations.
- **Cosmological Constant**: Mapping the vacuum energy to tensor network properties remains an open structural challenge.
- **Full Background Independence**: Ensuring the network architecture does not implicitly presuppose an external manifold.
