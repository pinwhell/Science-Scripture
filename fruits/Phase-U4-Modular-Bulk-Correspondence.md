# Phase U4: Modular Bulk Correspondence

---

**Scope**: Algebraic QFT / Modular Structure  
**Status**: Authorized by Director  
**Boundary Control**: STRICT. Modular Hamiltonian $\neq$ Energy. No RT formula.

---

## 1. Objective
To identify the unique boundary operator (the **Modular Hamiltonian** $\hat{H}_{mod}$) whose flow matches the bulk **Killing flow** in the Rindler wedge. This phase establishes the quantum-side precursor to unification without assuming a geometric metric.

## 2. Theoretical Basis: Bisognano-Wichmann Theorem
We leverage the property that for vacuum states in a wedge region, the modular flow acts as a geometric boost. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Director's Hardening Disclaimer**:
> This correspondence is exact only for wedge regions in relativistic QFT with Lorentz symmetry. No claim of global validity is made.

### Key Components:
- **Modular Hamiltonian ($\hat{H}_{mod}$)**: Defined as $-\ln \Delta$ where $\Delta$ is the modular operator.
- **Modular Flow**: $\sigma_s(\rho) = \Delta^{is} \rho \Delta^{-is}$.
- **Wedge Correspondence**: Mapping the bulk Killing parameter $\lambda$ to the modular flow parameter $s$.
    - *Note: The numerical factor $2\pi$ is fixed by Lorentz boost normalization, not thermodynamic considerations.*

## 3. Hard Rules (Director's Gate)
- **Modular Hamiltonian $\neq$ Energy**: It generates flow, but its spectrum and definition are distinct from the physical Hamiltonian $H_{phys}$.
- **Vacuum $\neq$ Empty**: The vacuum is a structured state with non-trivial modular properties, not a state of "nothingness."
- **No RT Formula**: We do not yet assume area is proportional to entanglement entropy. That mapping is reserved for the Phase U5 Nexus.

## 4. Interpretive Appendix (PCI/PAI)

**PCI Statement**: The correspondence between bulk symmetry and boundary information structure is a manifestation of the "unity of the Logos" (John 1:3). The same intelligibility that governs the cosmos (GR) also governs the substrate (QM).

**PAI Statement**: Modular flow is the actualization of relational structure. It is the information-theoretic "clock" that remains consistent with the geometric "clock" in the semiclassical window.
