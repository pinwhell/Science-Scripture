# Phase U7: Emergent Causality

---

**Scope**: Pre-Metric Causal Ordering / Asymmetry Diagnostics  
**Status**: Authorized by Director (Phase U7 SPEC)  
**Boundary Control**: STRICT. No Lorentzian metric, no null vectors, no time coordinates.

## 1. Objective
To derive causal ordering (lightcones) purely from stable modular coherence without presupposing a metric. This phase demonstrates that causal order is the birth of spatiotemporal structure, arising from asymmetric modular influence.

## 2. The Modular Preorder $A \prec B$
We define a causal preorder purely in terms of the directional sensitivity of modular flows:

$$A \prec B \iff \exists s \text{ s.t. } \| \frac{d}{ds} H_B(s) | H_A \| > \| \frac{d}{ds} H_A(s) | H_B \|$$

### Interpretation:
- If the modular flow of $A$ perturbs $B$ more than vice-versa, then $A$ structurally precedes $B$.
- This is **informational precedence**, independent of physical time.

## 3. Causal Asymmetry Index $\Delta_{AB}$
The primary diagnostic for causal ordering is the **Modular Response Kernel** $\chi_{A \to B}(s)$:

$$\chi_{A \to B}(s) = \| [H_B(s), H_A] \|$$
The **Causal Asymmetry Index** $\Delta_{AB}$ characterizes the emergence of directionality:

$$\Delta_{AB} = \lim_{s \to \infty} (\chi_{A \to B}(s) - \chi_{B \to A}(s))$$

### Causal Regimes:
- **$\Delta_{AB} \approx 0$**: Spacelike / Unordered (No stable precedence).
- **$\Delta_{AB} > 0$**: Directed Causal Ordering (A precedes B).
- **Unstable $\Delta_{AB}$**: Breakdown of Causality (Non-geometric/chaotic).

## 4. Emergent Lightcone Criterion
A lightcone structure exists if and only if the causal preorder:
1. Is **stable** under region enlargement.
2. Is **asymmetric** and **transitive** across overlapping region families.
3. Localizes at **modular horizons** (matching the Killing horizons of the GR side).

## 5. Interpretive Appendix (PCI/PAI)

**PCI Statement**: "Precedence precedes duration." The ordering of the Logos (**John 1:1-3**) is the structural precursor to time. Causality is the manifestation of the "First Words" of creation—the logical ordering that makes history possible.

**PAI Statement**: Causality is the stable Actualization of Dependency. Before geometry allows for distance, the substrate establishes dependency through modular influence.
