# Phase U6.2: Dynamic Breakdown of Geometric Representability

---

**Scope**: Modular Instability / Dynamic Failure Mode  
**Status**: Authorized by Director (Phase U6.2 SPEC)  
**Boundary Control**: STRICT. Modular Flow ($s$) only. No physical time. No thermodynamics.

## 1. Objective
To characterize the dynamic instability of modular compatibility ($s$-flow) as representational coherence fails. This phase identifies how spacetime loss stability as a structural attractor.

## 2. The Compatibility Flow Gradient $\Gamma_C(A, B | \rho)$
We define the **Compatibility Flow Gradient** as the primary dynamic instability diagnostic. Per Director mandate (Shared-Flow correction), generators are evolved relative to a shared reference modular Hamiltonian $H_{ref}$:

$$\Gamma_C(A,B|\rho) = \left\| \frac{d}{ds} [H_{mod}^A(s), H_{mod}^B(s)] \right\|$$
where $H^i(s) = e^{is H_{ref}} H^i e^{-is H_{ref}}$.

### Rationale:
In Tomita-Takesaki theory, modular flow is defined relative to a specific state $\rho$. Overlapping regions do not possess independent modular clocks; their instability is captured by the mismatch between their local generators when evolved by the shared flow of the reference algebra (e.g., an enclosing region or a Rindler proxy).
- **$\Gamma_C \approx 0$**: Stable Semiclassical regime. Modular flows approximately commute, preserving Killing symmetry.
- **Rapidly Growing $\Gamma_C$**: Unstable Transition regime (The Cliff Face). High sensitivity to state deformation.
- **$\Gamma_C$ Saturation/Fluctuation**: Chaotic Non-Geometric regime. Complete representational collapse.

## 3. Dynamic Regimes of Space-Time

1. **Stable Semiclassical Regime**
   - $C \approx 1$, $\Gamma_C \approx 0$.
   - Modular flows are stable structural attractors.
   - GR Intuition: Stable Killing horizons and boost invariance.

2. **Unstable Transition Regime (The Cliff Face)**
   - $\Gamma_C$ spikes.
   - Representational fragility emerges.
   - GR Intuition: Near-caustics and breakdown of boost symmetry in the interior.

3. **Chaotic Non-Geometric Regime**
   - $\Gamma_C$ saturates or fluctuates wildly.
   - No consistent atlas or causal slicing possible.
   - Underlying quantum logic persists without spatiotemporal actualization.

## 4. Continuity & No-Go Boundaries
- **No Physical Time**: Dynamics is tracked in the modular parameter $s$.
- **No Scrambling/Thermalization**: We are mapping structural instability, not entropy production.
- **The Bridge**: Einstein geometry is recovered as the *stable* sector of modular flow space.

## 5. Interpretive Appendix (PCI/PAI)

**PCI Statement**: Actualization of order is a continuous achievement sustained by the Logos (**Colossians 1:17**). The instability gradient $\Gamma_C$ measures the threshold where the sustaining coherence of the Logos no longer manifests as a stable geometric stage.

**PAI Statement**: Actuality is not a "once-and-for-all" given but is continuously actualized through relational consistency. High modular instability represents the reversion of actuality into the raw potential of the substrate.
