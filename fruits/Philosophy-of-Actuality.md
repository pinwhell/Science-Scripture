# The Ontology of Actuality in a Probabilistic Framework

**Status**: Internal Draft (Philosophy-Facing Stream)
**Scope**: Ontology, Normativity, Actuality
**Constraint**: PCI Focus (Actuality $\neq$ Probability)

## 1. The Category Distinction: Measure vs. Fact
Standard interpretations of quantum mechanics often conflate limiting frequencies (probability measures) with the ontological status of outcomes. We propose a strict category distinction:
- **Physics**: Describes the *possibility space* (the measure-theoretic structure of Hilbert space).
- **Ontology**: Grounds the *actuality* (the facticity of the realized history).

> [!NOTE]
> **Axiom**: "Physics explains probabilities. Actuality is not a probability."  
> To treat actuality as a variable within the formalism (e.g., a "collapse parameter") is a category error. Actuality is the *condition* of the formalism having a referent, not a term within it.

## 2. Against Illusionism: Grounding Normativity
If the mathematical structure is self-grounding, then "agency" and "normativity" (meaning, ethics) are reduced to epiphenomenal illusions or user-interface fictions.
- **The PCI Response**: We reject illusionism. Normativity is **disclosed**, not projected.
- **Grounding**: The intelligibility of the structure (Logos) is the same ground that sustains the agent. Therefore, agency is a **participatory mode** of the Logos, not a fiction generated by the mechanics.

## 3. The "Quietist" Realism
We adopt a position of "Brute-Fact Quietism" regarding the mechanism of selection. The question "Why this outcome and not that one?" has no *physical* answer (because the measure is probabilistic) and no *mechanical* answer (because there are no hidden variables).
- **The Answer is Ontological**: The outcome is actual because it is sustained. The "mechanism" of sustainment is not a scientific variable.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Clarification: Non-Bruteness $\neq$ Determinism**
> To say that an outcome is "ontologically grounded" (not brute) does NOT entail that it is "causally determined" or "micromanaged" in a mechanistic sense.
>
> **Ontological Non-Bruteness**: The event has a sufficient reason for its *being* (sustaining Ground).
> **Causal Openness**: The event retains its statistical freedom and contingency within the physical description.
>
> We reject the inference that "God grounds the event $\implies$ God rigs the dice." Providence upholds the *entire structure*, including its genuine open possibilities.

## 4. Conclusion
This framework allows for a robust scientific realism (physics describes the true structure) without collapsing into a "block universe" determinism or an "illusionist" nihilism. By keeping Actuality distinct from Probability, we preserve the integrity of both the Law (physics) and the Fact (history).
