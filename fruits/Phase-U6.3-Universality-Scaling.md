# Phase U6.3: Universality & Scaling of Modular Instability

---

**Scope**: Universal Structural Scaling / Lyapunov Spectrum  
**Status**: Authorized by Director (Phase U6.3 SPEC)  
**Boundary Control**: STRICT. Scaling and Universality only. Pre-Causal.

## 1. Objective
To demonstrate that the collapse of geometric representability (The Geometric Cliff) obeys universal scaling laws. This phase proves that Einstein geometry is a universal structural fixed point (attractor) of modular flow space, rather than a microscopic accident.

## 2. The Modular Lyapunov Exponent $\lambda_{mod}$
The order parameter for this phase is the long-flow growth exponent of modular instability:

$$\lambda_{mod} = \lim_{s\to\infty} \frac{1}{s} \ln \Gamma_C(s)$$

### Structural Classification:
- **$\lambda_{mod} \leq 0$**: Semiclassical Attractor (Geometry holds).
- **$\lambda_{mod} > 0$**: Geometric Breakdown (Chaos onset).

## 3. The Three Universality Axes

### Axis 1: Region Scaling (Geometric Depth)
- **Goal**: Quantify how instability scales with overlap depth $|A \cap B|$.
- **Expectation**: For semiclassical states, $\lambda_{mod} \to 0$ as $|A \cap B| \to \infty$ (Stability of extended causal structure).

### Axis 2: State-Class Universality
- **Goal**: Test if the cliff profile is independent of the microscopic model (TFIM vs XXZ vs Random).
- **Criterion**: All theoretical models should collapse onto a single universal curve when rescaled by $x = (\lambda - \lambda_c)/\lambda_c$.

### Axis 3: Noise Robustness
- **Goal**: Verify that geometry is a structural property stable under microscopic perturbations.
- **Verification**: $\lambda_{mod}$ must remain $\leq 0$ for semiclassical states even under injection of non-Gaussian noise.

---

## 4. Continuity & No-Go Boundaries
- **No Background Metric**: Universality is derived from the algebra, not from a pre-set geometry.
- **No Thermodynamics**: $\lambda_{mod}$ is a structural growth rate, not a thermalization rate.
- **Firewall**: No claims of "bulk emergence" yet. This phase establishes the *validity* of the geometric representation, not its explicit construction (Phase U8).

## 5. Interpretive Appendix (PCI/PAI)

**PCI Statement**: Universality implies that the "Laws of the Logos" are invariant across scales and models. The "holding together" (**Colossians 1:17**) is a universal structural principle, not a local coincidence.

**PAI Statement**: The universal collapse profile represents the "Transition of Actuality." Geometry is the most stable actualization of relational information accessible to any finite observer.
